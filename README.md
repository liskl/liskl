## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior devops engineer who works [foghornconsulting](https://foghornconsulting.com).

In my work time I enjoy, Containerization, Kubernetes, Linux and AWS/GCP Related Problem Solving and Engineering, and overall just solving comple problems.
- ***Containerization**: Docker, Buildkit, and all things Alpine.
- ***Kubernetes**: Clusters of large and small size, doing pretty much anything, faas, web, monitoring, observability and ci-cd.
- ***Linux**: been exclusively *nix for about 10+ years now, with a sprinkling of FreeBSD mixed in for good measure.
- ***Cloud Computing**: Been Working in AWS for about 5 years now with a bit of GCP on the side.

In my spare time I enjoy, Solar Energy, DIY Powerwalls, Kubernetes, Micro-Electronics, woodworking, 3d-printing, Golang, Digital Hoarding, and really just solving complex and complicated problems.

<!--
**liskl/liskl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ***Home**: DIY Whole Home Solar, .
- ***Ops**: Homelab because we all have servers, and running things on those servers should be easy. I like Kubernetes, and I like bare-metal private clusters.
